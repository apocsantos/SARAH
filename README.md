Speech Accessibility Resource & Assistive Hub

A pet project, done in a few hours, single page, extremely simple, but works with any TTS able browser, and aims to aid communications for people with disability.

The name is just a coincidence, and any similarity to any person's name is highly disincouraged. [No films please, i'm tiered of human stupidity].

It aims to help people with ASD and any other that may need help in verbal speach.

This is still in alpha development.
